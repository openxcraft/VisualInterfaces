# Roadmap

Planned work is recorded as concrete, actionable items. Completed items move
to `CHANGELOG.md`; this file keeps only open work and the coverage review.

## Classification

- Category: planning record for all categories.

When to use:

- After each deep editorial review, to record the next improvements.
- Before starting a change, to check whether it is already planned.

When to avoid:

- As a log of completed work; that belongs in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Elements and components

- Coverage matrix, reviewed on a fixed cycle.
- Improvement actions, each with an owner step and a done condition.
- A list of the least covered areas, in priority order.

## Layout and responsive rules

- This file stays a single page; long detail belongs in the file it improves.
- Matrix rows are dimensions; columns are coverage levels.

## States

| State | Appearance | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | A roadmap item at rest, with full contrast and a clear label. | Ready for input or selection. |
| Hover | Pointer-only highlight: subtle background or border change. | No change on touch devices; hover never carries essential information alone. |
| Active | Pressed or selected appearance while interaction is in progress. | Feedback appears within 100 ms of input. |
| Disabled | Reduced contrast, no pointer response, still readable. | Explain why it is unavailable nearby when the reason is not obvious. |
| Loading | Skeleton blocks or a progress indicator replace live content. | Keep layout dimensions stable so content does not shift. |
| Empty | An empty roadmap after a review is a defect; every deep review adds at least three actions. | Offer one clear next action and, where relevant, a reset for filters. |
| Error | An item that cannot be done as written is rewritten with a smaller, testable step. | Keep entered data, place the message next to the problem, and offer a retry. |

## Coverage matrix

Rating: full = defined with states and an example or rule set; partial =
defined without an example; gap = named but not yet defined.

| Dimension | Full | Partial | Gap |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Web, mobile, tablet, kiosk, television, embedded, wearable | Desktop | — |
| Device input | Touch, pointer, keyboard, voice, gesture-only | Remote | — |
| Interface type | Web app, mobile app, kiosk, conversational, embedded | Spatial | — |
| Page pattern | Dashboard, mobile navigation, data table, checkout variants, onboarding, comparison, permission request, search results, landing, authentication, settings, commerce | — | — |
| State | All seven in catalog; offline, read-only, permission-denied; loading variants | — | — |

## Improvement actions

1. Consolidate the duplicated seven-state tables: replace the full table in
   each layout and trend file with a short pointer to `catalog/states.md`
   plus file-specific state notes. Done when `check_quality.py` no longer
   reports the duplicate-paragraph warning.
2. Add spatial page patterns: multi-window spatial layouts with per-window
   fallback modes (inline versus drop) and priority ordering when panel
   slots run out, building on `trends/2026/spatial-interfaces.md`; promote
   Spatial from partial to full in the matrix. Done when the new section
   passes all quality gates.
3. Add remote-control input guidance beyond the television layout: pointer,
   touch-surface, and scroll-wheel remote variants as an input section in
   `catalog/interfaces.md`, with focus behaviour per variant. Done when the
   new section passes all quality gates.
4. Add a wearable layout file (`layouts/watch.md`): glanceable surfaces,
   the ambient always-on state, round-display margins, and the two-tap
   overflow rule to the phone app. Done when the new file passes all
   quality gates.

## Review notes

- Most duplicated area: state descriptions repeated across layout and trend
  files. Consolidation target: keep the full wording in `catalog/states.md`
  and short rows plus a pointer elsewhere (now action 1).
- Least covered area: remote-control input beyond the television rules
  (pointer, touch-surface, and scroll-wheel remote variants); spatial
  interfaces remain partial pending a full page-pattern treatment (now
  actions 2 and 3); a dedicated wearable layout file is still open
  (action 4).
- Completed this review: comparison pattern, permission-request flow
  pattern, and search-results pattern in `catalog/patterns.md` (with a
  cross-link from the permission-denied row in `catalog/states.md`);
  data-table grouped-loading and cell-action rules; new
  `layouts/tablet.md` (window size bands, navigation switching, two-pane
  thresholds, foldable postures); television layout deepened (type
  minimums, safe-area margins, spatial focus, remote input variants,
  real-distance testing); landing layout deepened (outcome-first hero,
  section order, form friction); authentication layout deepened
  (passkey-first flow, visible fallback chain, one-time enrollment,
  QR context, credential management); settings layout deepened (sidebar
  navigation, settings search design, danger zone); wearable interfaces
  section in `catalog/interfaces.md` with a cross-link to the spatial
  trend file; conversational trend gained an interruption-budget section;
  functional-motion trend gained reduced-motion swap rules; agentic trend
  gained the six trust patterns and the orchestration surface; new
  `trends/2026/spatial-interfaces.md`; headless behaviour primitive and
  form-builder confirmation rules in `catalog/primitives.md`; 55 new
  source records (115 total); coverage matrix refreshed (tablet, wearable,
  landing, authentication, settings, comparison, permission request,
  search results, and loading variants promoted to full).
- Completed this review: embedded display layout (`layouts/embedded.md`,
  referenced from `catalog/interfaces.md`); gesture-only worked example
  with thresholds and recovery; voice state matrix extended with
  per-state timeouts, barge-in timing, and backchannel rules; spatial
  interface note with depth arrangements, comfort zone, and flat-view exit;
  empty-state taxonomy (already recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`); inline
  assistant-action pattern cross-linked from
  `trends/2026/agentic-ux.md`; multimodal voice-plus-screen pairing
  cross-linked from `catalog/interfaces.md`; onboarding prefill and
  default rules.

## Pre-publish checklist

- [ ] Title and short description are present and accurate.
- [ ] Classification and when-to-use guidance are present.
- [ ] Elements, layout, and responsive rules are complete.
- [ ] All seven states are defined: default, hover, active, disabled, loading, empty, error.
- [ ] Text is neutral, short, and free of names of persons and organisations in editorial prose.
- [ ] No references appear outside the resources files.
- [ ] No secrets, contact details, local filenames, or system paths are present.
- [ ] Visuals, if any, are abstract shapes only.
- [ ] Internal links resolve and headings follow a consistent order.
